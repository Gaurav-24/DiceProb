# Dice Problem
To Start with the program, run the below command with the values of No of Players and Max Score that can be accumulated:
# npm run start [NoOfPlayers] [MaxScoreAccumulated];

e.g., npm run start 5 20;

Once We run the code, we will get an option to press r to roll the dice. We need to press r and then press enter and it will roll the dice. Incase anything else is pressed, the same user will be prompted to roll the dice again.
